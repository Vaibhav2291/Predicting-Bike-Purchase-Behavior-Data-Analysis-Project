## Project Overview  
This project involved analyzing a structured customer dataset to identify key factors influencing bike purchasing decisions. The objective was to generate business-relevant insights by examining demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral attributes to inform marketing and customer targeting strategies.

The project followed a complete analysis cycle: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, segmentation, and insight generation — completed using Microsoft Excel and guided by real-world analyst workflows demonstrated in public training content.

## Objectives  
- Clean and standardize raw survey data to prepare for analysis  
- Analyze customer demographics and behavioral variables associated with purchase patterns  
- Segment the dataset to highlight high-opportunity customer groups  
- Visualize key patterns to support clear communication of findings  
- Derive actionable insights to guide business decisions

---

## 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Checked for and resolved missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting  
- Standardized categorical variables (e.g., Education, Marital Status, Commute Distance)  
- Validated numerical ranges for fields like Income, Age, and Commute Distance

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key patterns uncovered during analysis include:

- Customers with higher annual incomes were significantly more likely to purchase a bike  
- Education level (Bachelor’s and above) positively correlated with purchase likelihood  
- Mid-range commute distances (5–10 miles) were associated with higher purchase rates  
- Marital status and occupation were key behavioral indicators, with married professionals demonstrating higher purchase tendencies

---

## 3. Customer Segmentation  
Using the cleaned data, customer segments were defined to support targeted business strategies:

- High-income, college-educated professionals with moderate commute distances  
- Married individuals showing higher interest in commuting solutions  
- Distinct low-conversion groups based on occupation and income thresholds

These segments can help inform differentiated marketing campaigns, lead scoring, and promotional outreach.

## 4. Visualizations  
Developed clear, stakeholder-friendly visualizations in Excel, including:

- Bar charts showing bike purchase rates by income, education, and commute distance  
- Crosstab summaries comparing occupation with purchase behavior  
- Pie and column charts for gender, marital status, and customer distribution

---

## Key Findings  
- Income, education, and commute distance were the most reliable predictors of bike purchase behavior  
- Married, mid-commute professionals form a key target segment  
- Certain occupational categories consistently showed low likelihood of purchase, informing exclusion targeting  
- Segmentation helped surface marketing opportunities based on actual behavioral data rather than assumptions

---

## Deliverables  
- Cleaned and structured Excel workbook  
- Insight summary sheet outlining trends, opportunities, and risks  
- Visuals embedded within workbook for stakeholder use or export

---

## Conclusion  
This project showcases practical data analysis capabilities using Excel, with a strong focus on business interpretation and stakeholder-relevant insights. It reflects end-to-end ownership of the analytical process — from raw data to actionable strategy — and provides a foundation for applying similar techniques in customer analytics, marketing strategy, or sales enablement.
